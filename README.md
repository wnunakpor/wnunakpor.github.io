## Introduction
GitHub is a cloud-based service that helps developers store, manage, and track changes to their code. With GitHub, teams can collaborate on projects efficiently using Git, the distributed version control system.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub provides a web-based interface for Git, making it easier to collaborate with other developers, track changes in code, and manage different versions of projects. It is widely used in the open-source community and professional development environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Repository**: A repository (or repo) is where your project lives, including all files and their version history.
- **Branch**: A branch is a separate version of your repository, used to work on different features or fixes.
- **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to your code.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another.
- **Merge**: Incorporating changes from one branch into another.
- **Fork**: Creating a copy of someone else's repository under your own account.
